# NFT - Non Fungible Tokens

## Education
* Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), also often referred to as crypto collectibles, expand upon this idea.
* Unlike cryptocurrencies, where all tokens are created equally, non-fungible tokens are each unique and limited in quantity.
* NFTs are one of the key building blocks of a new, blockchain-powered digital economy.
* Several projects are experimenting with NFTs for a variety of use cases, such as gaming, digital identity, licensing, certificates, and fine art.
* They even allow fractional ownership of high-value items.
* Biggest example of NFT-based DApp is CryptoKitties, a platform which congested the Ethereum Blockchain in late 2017.
* Definition: A non-fungible token (NFT) is a type of cryptographic token on a blockchain that represents a unique asset. These can either be entirely digital assets or tokenized versions of real-world assets.
* They are not interchangeable with each other. In fact, they may function as proof of authenticity and ownership within the digital realm.
* Fungibility means that an asset’s individual units are interchangeable and essentially indistinguishable from each other. E.g. fiat currencies are fungible, because each unit is interchangeable with any other equivalent individual unit. A 10 USD bill is interchangeable with another genuine 10 USD bill.
* This is essential for an asset to be uniquely defined digitally, that aims to act as a medium of exchange. 
* Fungibility is a desirable property for currency because it enables free exchange.
* NFTs can be traded in open marketplaces. These markets connect buyers with sellers, and the value of each token is unique. Naturally, NFTs are prone to price changes in response to market supply and demand.
* Just like with any other valuable item, the value isn’t inherent to the object itself but is rather assigned by people who deem it valuable.
* NFTs can be used by decentralized applications (DApps) to issue unique digital items and crypto-collectibles. These tokens can either be a collectible item, an investment product, or something else.
* Gaming economies are nothing new. And since many online games have already had their own economies, using blockchain to tokenize gaming assets is taking only a step further. In fact, the use of NFTs could potentially solve or mitigate the common problem of inflation that many games have.
* Digital identity is also a sector that can benefit from the properties of NFTs. Storing identification and ownership data on the blockchain would increase privacy and data integrity for many people around the world. At the same time, easy and trustless transfers of these assets could reduce friction in the global economy.
* Decentraland is a decentralized virtual reality world where players can own and exchange pieces of virtual land and other in-game NFT items. Cryptovoxels is a similar game where players can build, develop, and exchange virtual property.
* Gods Unchained is a digital collectible card game where cards are issued as NFTs on the blockchain. Since each digital card is unique, players can own and trade them with the same level of ownership as if they were physical cards.
* Crypto Stamps are issued by the Austrian Postal Service and connect the digital world to the real-world. These stamps are used to transport mail like any other stamp. But, they are also saved as digital images on the Ethereum blockchain, making them a tradable digital collectible.
